## Notes
- Project agent types not registered; dispatch = general-purpose + model override + inlined role (human OK'd).
- MAX_PARALLEL_WRITERS=6; ≤3 Gradle-heavy at once.
- Handoffs archived to plan/handoffs/<ID>.md after merge (keeps HANDOFF.md off main → no rebase conflicts).
- Model tiers (ADR-004): `fable` tickets → Opus with architect role; escalation tops out at Opus. No Fable agents at all (human: burns usage). Resumes of old Fable agents are forbidden — restart on Opus in the same worktree. Agents must report tool refusals as BLOCKED, not work around them.
- Review rounds (human, 2026-11-12): loop while findings are REAL — blocker/major with a concrete failure scenario (inputs → wrong result/data loss/divergence). Minors and style never block (→ FOLLOWUPS). Re-reviews verify prior findings + only genuinely new majors. Safety cap: §9 (5 attempts → BLOCKED_HUMAN).

## Pending human questions
- none blocking. See plan/HUMAN_CHECKS.md.

- T008b jpdb fixture aligned to real export shape (invented values)
- T009 Helm chart + k3d — lint/template clean; k3d /healthz ok
- S02 jpdb map spike — 99.93% hit rate (GATE-S02 not triggered); jpdb vid == JMdict seq

- T008 golden fixtures — 240 FSRS vectors (py-fsrs 6.3.2), dict subsets, media, jpdb shape (unverified)
- T001 monorepo scaffold — make test green; compose minio unpullable → ADR-003/T001b
