## Notes
- Project agent types not registered; dispatch = general-purpose + model override + inlined role (human OK'd).
- MAX_PARALLEL_WRITERS=6; ≤3 Gradle-heavy at once. Human (go hard): up to 3 concurrent reviewers allowed.
- Handoffs archived to plan/handoffs/<ID>.md after merge (keeps HANDOFF.md off main → no rebase conflicts).
- Model tiers (ADR-004): `fable` tickets → Opus with architect role; escalation tops out at Opus. No Fable agents at all (human: burns usage). Resumes of old Fable agents are forbidden — restart on Opus in the same worktree. Agents must report tool refusals as BLOCKED, not work around them.
- Review rounds (human, 2026-11-12): loop while findings are REAL — blocker/major with a concrete failure scenario (inputs → wrong result/data loss/divergence). Minors and style never block (→ FOLLOWUPS). Re-reviews verify prior findings + only genuinely new majors. Safety cap: §9 (5 attempts → BLOCKED_HUMAN).

## Pending human questions
- none blocking. See plan/HUMAN_CHECKS.md.
